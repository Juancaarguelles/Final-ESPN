## ESPN WEB PAGE AUTOMATION (Final Test)
By Juan Camilo Arg√ºelles Ardila



## About

Here is the solution of the challenge of ESPN Web automation testing taking into account all the stablished parameters in the doc shared on the Slack channel. The execution of this testing program depends on the created suite with name "MySuite", here you can find 3 test executions:
1. The log in components validation.
2. The Sign up components validation.
3. The General interaction like the creation of an account, interaction and validation of some components of this page and finally do log out of this current account.

For this program all the good practices for testing were applied, like explicit time waits, assertions for validation and POM (Page object Model). Tests are ready to be executed.

Thank you!
